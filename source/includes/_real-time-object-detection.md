# Object Detection Example

## Installing Dependencies
For this tutorial, we will be using the python Tensorflow described earlier. 

> To install Tensorflow on your machine use:

```python

$ pip install tensorflow

```

> This tutorial will also use other libraries. Install these libraries just like Tensorflow using the following commands

```python

$ pip install --user Cython
$ pip install --user contextlib2
$ pip install --user pillow
$ pip install --user lxml
$ pip install --user jupyter
$ pip install --user matplotlib

```

This tutorial will also need models from Tensorflow and a way to use these models. 

First, install Protobuf: Protocol Buffers. This is Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Install Protobuf version 3.4 or above from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases.

Next, clone or download TensorFlow's Model from Github - https://github.com/tensorflow/models. Once downloaded and extracted rename "models-masters" to just "models".

Place both the models and protobuf folder under one folder called TensorFlow.

Finally, run the following command inside the TensorFlow folder.

"path_of_protobuf's bin"./bin/protoc object_detection/protos/

To check whether this worked or not, you can go to the protos folder inside models>object_detection>protos and there you can see that for every proto file there’s one python file created.

## Preparing to Code

After the enviorment is set up, its time to make our first Python Script. Enter the "object_detection" folder and create a new python file.

First, we need to import all of our libraries to set up our script. Follow the instructions to the right.

>Create our imports for the script.

``` python

import numpy as np
import os
import six.moves.urllib as urllib
import sys
import tarfile
import tensorflow as tf
import zipfile
 
from collections import defaultdict
from io import StringIO
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
 
sys.path.append("..")
from object_detection.utils import ops as utils_ops
 
from utils import label_map_util
 
from utils import visualization_utils as vis_util
 
```

Next, we need to download the model which is trained on the COCO dataset. COCO stands for Common Objects in Context. 

>This code provides the model and the frozen inference graph generated by TensorFlow.

``` python
MODEL_NAME = 'ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17'
MODEL_FILE = MODEL_NAME + '.tar.gz'
DOWNLOAD_BASE = 'http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/'
 
PATH_TO_CKPT = MODEL_NAME + '/frozen_inference_graph.pb'
 
PATH_TO_LABELS = os.path.join('data', 'mscoco_label_map.pbtxt')
 
NUM_CLASSES = 90

```

>This code will download the images from the model and also the frozen inference graph from TensorFlow

``` python 
opener = urllib.request.URLopener()
opener.retrieve(DOWNLOAD_BASE + MODEL_FILE, MODEL_FILE)
tar_file = tarfile.open(MODEL_FILE)
for file in tar_file.getmembers():
  file_name = os.path.basename(file.name)
  if 'frozen_inference_graph.pb' in file_name:
    tar_file.extract(file, os.getcwd())
 
detection_graph = tf.Graph()
with detection_graph.as_default():
  od_graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
  with tf.gfile.GFile(PATH_TO_CKPT, 'rb') as fid:
    serialized_graph = fid.read()
    od_graph_def.ParseFromString(serialized_graph)
    tf.import_graph_def(od_graph_def, name='')
```


## Setting up the Images

Next, the code will load all the labels for the dataset and also convert the dataset to a numPy array in order to process the results.

This will ensure that the data is in the correct format for our code to train on the images.

The images will also be labeled in order for the program to be able to recognize and train using the images.

>This code will load labels for the dataset

``` python
label_map = label_map_util.load_labelmap(PATH_TO_LABELS)
categories = label_map_util.convert_label_map_to_categories(label_map, max_num_classes=NUM_CLASSES, use_display_name=True)
category_index = label_map_util.create_category_index(categories)
```

>This code will convert the dataset to a numPy array. 

``` python
def load_image_into_numpy_array(image):
  (im_width, im_height) = image.size
  return np.array(image.getdata()).reshape(
      (im_height, im_width, 3)).astype(np.uint8)
```


>The path to the images for the testing purpose is defined here. Here we have a naming convention “image[i]” for i in (1 to n+1), n being the number of images provided.

``` python
PATH_TO_TEST_IMAGES_DIR = 'test_images'
TEST_IMAGE_PATHS = [ os.path.join(PATH_TO_TEST_IMAGES_DIR, 'image{}.jpg'.format(i)) for i in range(1, 8) ]

```

## Analyzing the Images

The code will then be ran on a single image, where it will detect objects within the image and create boxes around them. 

Finally, the code will provide the class of the object and the class score - or accuracy of said object belonging to said class.

The Final Loop will call all the functions mention above and will run the inference on all the input images one by one, which will provide the output of images in which objects are detected.

All output images will have labels and percentage scores of each object in the image being similar to the training data.

> This code will run inference of a single image.

``` python

def run_inference_for_single_image(image, graph):
  with graph.as_default():
    with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Get handles to input and output tensors
      ops = tf.get_default_graph().get_operations()
      all_tensor_names = {output.name for op in ops for output in op.outputs}
      tensor_dict = {}
      for key in [
          'num_detections', 'detection_boxes', 'detection_scores',
          'detection_classes', 'detection_masks'
     ]:
        tensor_name = key + ':0'
        if tensor_name in all_tensor_names:
          tensor_dict[key] = tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name(
            tensor_name)
      if 'detection_masks' in tensor_dict:
        # The following processing is only for single image
        detection_boxes = tf.squeeze(tensor_dict['detection_boxes'], [0])
        detection_masks = tf.squeeze(tensor_dict['detection_masks'], [0])
        # Reframe is required to translate mask from box coordinates to image coordinates and fit the image size.
        real_num_detection = tf.cast(tensor_dict['num_detections'][0], tf.int32)
        detection_boxes = tf.slice(detection_boxes, [0, 0], [real_num_detection, -1])
        detection_masks = tf.slice(detection_masks, [0, 0, 0], [real_num_detection, -1, -1])
        detection_masks_reframed = utils_ops.reframe_box_masks_to_image_masks(
            detection_masks, detection_boxes, image.shape[0], image.shape[1])
        detection_masks_reframed = tf.cast(
            tf.greater(detection_masks_reframed, 0.5), tf.uint8)
        # Follow the convention by adding back the batch dimension
        tensor_dict['detection_masks'] = tf.expand_dims(
            detection_masks_reframed, 0)
        image_tensor = tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('image_tensor:0')
 
        # Run inference
        output_dict = sess.run(tensor_dict,
            feed_dict={image_tensor: np.expand_dims(image, 0)})
 
        # all outputs are float32 numpy arrays, so convert types as appropriate
        output_dict['num_detections'] = int(output_dict['num_detections'][0])
        output_dict['detection_classes'] = output_dict[
          'detection_classes'][0].astype(np.uint8)
        output_dict['detection_boxes'] = output_dict['detection_boxes'][0]
        output_dict['detection_scores'] = output_dict['detection_scores'][0]
        if 'detection_masks' in output_dict:
          output_dict['detection_masks'] = output_dict['detection_masks'][0]
return output_dict

```

> Using a Loop, run the inference on each image to detect objects.

``` python

for image_path in TEST_IMAGE_PATHS:
  image = Image.open(image_path)
  # the array based representation of the image will be used later in order to prepare the
  # result image with boxes and labels on it.
  image_np = load_image_into_numpy_array(image)
  # Expand dimensions since the model expects images to have shape: [1, None, None, 3]
  image_np_expanded = np.expand_dims(image_np, axis=0)
  # Actual detection.
  output_dict = run_inference_for_single_image(image_np, detection_graph)
  # Visualization of the results of a detection.
  vis_util.visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(
      image_np,
      output_dict['detection_boxes'],
      output_dict['detection_classes'],
      output_dict['detection_scores'],
      category_index,
      instance_masks=output_dict.get('detection_masks'),
      use_normalized_coordinates=True,
      line_thickness=8)
plt.figure(figsize=IMAGE_SIZE)
plt.imshow(image_np)

```

##Live Object Detection

Finally, we will change this program to use live object detection. This will take a few tweaks to the original code, but will allow our program to use the computer's webcam to analyze images in real time and identify objects. 

First, a new library will need to be imported in order to use the live camera. This only takes an import and getting video capture using the OpenCV (or cv2) library.

Next, We will no longer need to load images from a directory, as OpenCV will take care of it.

We will no longer use matplotlib for the final image as OpenCV can also do this.

This code will use OpenCV in order to use the camera object to open a new window named "Object_Detection" which will grab images from the camera.

>Add the new import to the code after the previous imports



``` python
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```

> Remove this code for grabbing images from a directory

``` python
for image_path in TEST_IMAGE_PATHS:
image = Image.open(image_path)
# the array based representation of the image will be used later in order to prepare the
# result image with boxes and labels on it.
image_np = load_image_into_numpy_array(image)
```

> Add this code instead to grab images from OpenCV

``` python
while True:
ret, image_np = cap.read()
```

> Remove this code for creating the final image using matplotlib

``` python
plt.figure(figsize=IMAGE_SIZE)
plt.imshow(image_np)
```

> Add this code for creating the image using OpenCV

``` python
cv2.imshow('object detection', cv2.resize(image_np, (800,600)))
if cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
  cv2.destroyAllWindows()
  break
```

##Final Code

Now, we have our final code for detecting objects in real time using TensorFlow. 

After all of the revisions, this code now detects objects in real time using the computers camera and classify the objects found.

Thanks for using our tutorial and enjoy all that TensorFlow has to offer!

Thanks!
